## Contents

Relevant code is present in [App.js](./src/App.js). The code is divided into 3 sections and illustrates the core patterns of React+Redux.

* Context: The score along with increment and decrement functions are going to be stored in __ScoreContext__ in [context.js](./src/context.js)
* Two main components
	- __ScoreBoard__ : Stateless and displays main count stored in context, accessed through consumer and then looking at `score` property.
	- __Controller__ : Contains local states to track number of increments and decrements. Also, increment and decrement functions for global state are present in this. They are initialized in the `App` component and appropriately modify its state.
